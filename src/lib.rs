//! LightningScanner
//!
//! A lightning-fast memory pattern scanner, capable of scanning gigabytes of data per second.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use lightningscanner::Scanner;
//!
//! let binary = [0xab, 0xec, 0x48, 0x89, 0x5c, 0x24, 0xee, 0x48, 0x89, 0x6c];
//!
//! let scanner = Scanner::new("48 89 5c 24 ?? 48 89 6c");
//! let result = unsafe { scanner.find(binary.as_ptr(), binary.len()) };
//!
//! println!("{:?}", result);
//! ```
